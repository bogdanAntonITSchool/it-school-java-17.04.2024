1. Create two classes called Circle and Rectangle which extend a Shape abstract class.
Shape abstract class has a method called draw() which is implemented by Circle and Rectangle classes.
The draw method in Circle class should print “Drawing Circle” and draw method in Rectangle class should print “Drawing Rectangle”.
Please write a program to create a Shape list which can hold Circle and Rectangle objects, then iterate through the list and call draw method on each object.

2. Create a class Car with the following properties: String brand; String model; int year; double price.
Adapt the Car class to be able to add only unique cars in a HashSet.
The rules for equality are the following: two cars are equal if they have the same brand, model and year.

3. Create c class Runner with the following properties: String name; int age; int speed.
Adapt the Runner class to be able to add only unique runners in a TreeSet, ordered by speed.

4. Create a class called Person with the following properties: String name; int age; String job.
Create multiple instances of type Person and add them to a Map (the key can be an integer).
Please iterate over the map and print the name of each person.
